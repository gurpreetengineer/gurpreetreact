- 👋 Hi, I’m Gurpreet Singh
- 👀 I’m interested in Frontend Development, mainly using React, redux, Angular, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning node, dot net and blazor. Besides that, I believe in having proficiency in at least one so I'm polishing my skills on, specifically,
React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some frontend UI projects. I am a freelancer but willing to work in an organization who respects its employees.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me at my email, ie gurpreet.reactdev@gmail.com.
